This is a set of (interactive?) demos for systemd and pystemd.

install
-------

we take a crap tons of liberties at install... but in general

    [~] ./install

is enought ... at somepoint there we run systemd-run to isolate the install


start isolated tmux
---------------------

[~] ./venv/bin/start-demo

start demo
----------

inside tmux now


[~] systemd-emo

and the just hit n to test every demo
